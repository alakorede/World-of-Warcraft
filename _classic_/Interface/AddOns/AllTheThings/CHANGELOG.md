    Ref: 0cd36941a1f5b17d487af163fd92bcf17a2fee31  
- Add Plunderstorm spoil reward  
- Classic: Improved the Sync Window by limiting chunks to one character and responses to a queue.  
- [Logic] ExtendClass no longer copies any connected 'variants' from the extended Class  
    This fixes some Classic window commands to load properly (though in testing, the functionality of the window seemed undesirable for typical gameplay)

- [Logic] Retail: Force GetDataCache to be called during 'OnLoad'  
    Prior it was called due to the OnReady loading of the TradeSkills window at that time, and perhaps the script timeout has been reduced drastically by that point within instances for an initial character login. [There doesn't seem to be an API or cvar available which tells the current script timeout]  
- [Logic] Retail: Slight cleanup and simplification of functions within GetSearchResults
